=== MAC OS X: ===
 use fink to install autotools, automake, autoconf
 1.  Mac OS X builds require additional tools.  Install:
  -BSD Subsystem (from Mac OS X Installer) - installed by default
  -Apple Developer Tools (XCode) 2.4.1 or later http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/
  -Fink and FinkCommander - http://finkproject.org/
  -Fink packages: autoconf automake gcc4 (which includes g++ and gfortran)
  -A different GFortran is here (untested) :
    http://www.macresearch.org/xcode_gfortran_plugin_update 
 2.  Make sure gfortran is in your path! Edit the file ~/.cshrc :
    export PATH=/sw/bin:$PATH
  and then []$ source ~/.cshrc

 For some reason, when using GCC gfortran MacOSX can't find its BLAS.  Use this instead:
./configure -C --with-blas=/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/vecLib CXX=/sw/bin/g++-4 CC=/sw/bin/gcc-4 F77=/sw/bin/gfortran

#trilinos has trouble building under OSX with the default compilers.  Use Fink's instead. These are under /sw/bin/g??-4
#The default compilers don't work well.  If you need to use them, You need to specify /usr/local/bin/g77 if you installed a fortran compiler yourself.


LINUX: Make sure your system defaults to gcc compilers, version 4 or greater.  If you have older GCCs installed along with version 4, you may have to set these variables to force the newer version:
CC=gcc4
CXX=g++4
F77=gfortran



svn co <path to repository>/SpatialOps/trunk <check out path>

T#hese steps require autotools 1.9 (automake, autoconf, etc.)
# which are included with most Linux systems.
#
#They will generate the portable buildsystem.  We don't need these
#steps after the build system is checked-in to the repo
aclocal

automake --add-missing
autoconf

#Now get and install boost, trilinos, daixtrose inside trunk
tar xzf boost_1_33_1.tar.gz
tar xzf daixtrose-0.0.3.tar.gz
tar xzf trilinos-7.0.6.tar.gz

#remove this line (#733):
vi trilinos-7.0.6/packages/epetraext/Makefile.in
        if [ $(srcdir) != $(top_builddir) ]; then cp -f $(srcdir)/example/inout/matlab.h5 $(top_builddir)/example/inout/matlab.h5 ; fi

#Now we don't even have to touch these packages.  The buildsystem
#will link into them by itself.

#Now just:
./configure -C CC=g++
#...wait... as dependencies are built first...

make
make install
