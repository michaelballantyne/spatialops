=== MAC OS X: ===
1. Mac OS X builds require additional tools.  Install:
    -BSD Subsystem (from Mac OS X Installer) - installed by default
    -Developer Tools (XCode) >= 2.4.1 http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/
    -Fink (and FinkCommander if desired) - http://finkproject.org/
    -Fink packages: autoconf automake gcc4 (which includes g++)

2. Make sure gcc4 is in your path!
    echo PATH=/sw/bin:$PATH >> ~/.cshrc
    source ~/.cshrc


=== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (ALL SYSTEMS): ===
1. You must have GCC version 4 or newer.  If you have other versions installed,
   you may have to set these variables to force the newer version:
      CC=gcc4
      CXX=g++4

2. If you got the source code from SVN, you must create the buildsystem:
      autoreconf --install
   If you got the source code from a tarball, disregard this step.

3. Install the packages 'blas-devel' and 'lapack-devel'

4. Install the packages 'boost' >= 1.33.1 and 'trilinos' >= 7.0.6

5. Create a build directory:
      mkdir sops-build
      cd sops-build 

6. Configure and make:
      ../configure <options>	(../configure --help for usage)
      make
      make check		(to run the testsuite)
      sudo make install
